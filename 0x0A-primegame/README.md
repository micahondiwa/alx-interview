# Prime game.

- Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 upto but not including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game. 
- They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. 
- Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine the winner for each game.
